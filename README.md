# NDVI

# NDVI Calculation for Hyderabad Region using Python in Jupyter Notebook

This project demonstrates how to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the Hyderabad region using Python within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Overview

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a simple graphical indicator that can be used to analyze remote sensing measurements, typically from a space platform, assessing whether the target being observed contains live green vegetation or not.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook in this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `rasterio`, `matplotlib`
